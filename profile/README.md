## Surgical Robotics AI

Our mission is to advance the application of machine learning in robotic surgery.
Our primary application domain is the telesurgical approach exemplified in operating rooms by the da Vinci surgical system
and in research labs by the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) and Raven II open platforms.
